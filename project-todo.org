* Project Todo
** TODO Add per data transformations in thread
   same idea as the board and thread, but now for each post in the thread
** TODO Add better inline replies with overlays
** TODO make the buffers read only
   marks and such get messed up if you accidentally type something while browsing
** TODO add thread watching
*** TODO add notifications for changes
    think 4chanx
** TODO more sophisticated search and filtering
   basically regexes
** TODO add posting
   fuck me no documentation
   I fucking hate REST
*** xwidget support
    going to have to use this for the google recaptcha 
** TODO add support for similar *chan boards
   think lainchan, 8chan, etc
   any tinychan ones will be minimal effort, but 8chan has a different api
** TODO mouse support
   click thumbnails to open full sized versions
   hover over for full sized image? is that possible??
   either way, there should be an option to either expand inline (up to a point based off file dimensions)
   or create a new buffer with the file
** TODO extract urls from parenthesis if needed when using list-urls
** TODO viper-mode support
** TODO Utilize defcustom where it makes sense.
** TODO add /t/ magnet support in addition the URLs
    [[https://github.com/skangas/mentor/issues][mentor]] might be dead?, but it's also possible to just call transmission from shell commands
    transmission-cli is a good choice
*** DONE transmission
    CLOSED: [2018-08-16 Thu 06:20]
    transmission-daemon's option '-c' allows automatic adding for .torrent files in a certain
    directory, so just download the torrent files into that directory
    [[file:q4-transmission.el%20][transmission]]
*** TODO function that allows easy access to links 
    searches post for magnet links/.torrent files, enumerates them, and lets the user chose interactivly
    which ones to add
** TODO set up photo download dir to prompt for full, not relative path when var is set to nil
** TODO add optional faces for tripcodes, names, dubs/trips/quads/etc..
** TODO get /pol/ flags centered in the row instead of at the bottom (looks weird af)
** TODO /pol/ ID support
